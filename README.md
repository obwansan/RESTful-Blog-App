# How to set up the app
* Clone the repo
* `cd` into the directory
* Make sure you've got node and npm installed
* Run `npm install` to get the packages listed in package.json
* Install and Run MongoDB (see https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html)
* Run `node app.js` (this might automatically open the app in a browser)
* If not, open `localhost/3000` in a browser
