// Compile the Blog schema into a Blog model (kind of like a class in PHP) that can 
// be used to create, read, update and delete blogs in the DB.
// You pass the singular version of your model (called "Blog") and mongoose automagically 
// creates a pluralised collection in the database (e.g. db.blogs).
// Convention is to capitalize a model ("Blog"), just like with PHP classes...

var Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blogSchema);


// INDEX restful route
// After the '/blogs' route is hit (i.e. a get request to '/blogs' is performed by entering 
// that URL), a callback function is called. It's passed the request and response object (how?)
// When Blog.find() returns all blogs from the mongoDB:
// - all the blogs are returned and passed as an object into the callback. So is an error message, if there is one.
// - the passed callback function is called. The inner callback has access to the response object
// passed into the outer callback (for res.render) and all the blogs. These are passed into index.ejs
// as the 'blogs' value on the 'blogs' key (which can be used in index.ejs).
